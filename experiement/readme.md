  All experimental results are in this folder.

  There are experiments on three different dataset with several multi-task learning structures. The source code with the same 
  
name of experiment result can be found in the source folder.

  I use three datasets for experiements: fashion-mnist(60000 training images. 10000 test images), cifar100(60000 training 
  
images, 10000 test images), office-home(about 3000 training images, about 10000 test images). Two classification tasks are 

trained together in all experiments.
